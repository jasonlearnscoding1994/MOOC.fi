// Exercise 21: Leap year
// Create a program that checks whether the given year is a leap year.
// A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. But if the year is divisible 
// by 100, it is a leap year only when it is also divisble by 400.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class LeapYear {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Type a year: ");
        int year = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
        
        if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0){ // Leap year if year is divisible by 4 and not by 100.
            System.out.println("The year is a leap year.");
        }
        else if (year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 == 0){ // If divisible by 100, then year needs to be divisible by 400.
            System.out.println("The year is a leap year.");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("The year is not a leap year.");
